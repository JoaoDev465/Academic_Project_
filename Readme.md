# Academic_Project_

An academic repository developed for practicing programming logic in Python. The project contains several simulators that apply concepts such as loops, conditional statements, exception handling (`try/except`), and user interaction.

## Available Simulators

1. **Cadaster Simulator**  
   Simulates a user or product registration system.

2. **Chicken Breast Seller**  
   Simulates the sale of chicken breast, including calculations and order management.

3. **Installment Simulator**  
   Allows simulating financial installments and calculating installment amounts.

4. **T-Shirt Factory Order Simulator**  
   Simulates orders in a t-shirt factory, applying logic for inventory control and price calculation.

## Technologies Used

- Python 3.x
- Structured programming concepts
- Error handling with `try/except`
